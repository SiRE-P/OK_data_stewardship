#--------- these are files that AO may check against the ones above

THESE ARE THE ONES I ORIGINALLY CHOSE TO UPLOAD (where they differ from BJ's)
(these are for AO to check against the inputted data)

(2005)
2005 sk-age.xls
From: Margot's files
***not sure if "2005 ONA broodstock data.xls" is relevant; there's some deadpitch data in that file, too

(2006)
2006 Adult Sx Biosampling.xls
From: Margot's files

(2008)
!Deadpitch_08_MASTER.xls
From: Margot's files
-there seems to be an original file in there too, "Deadpitch_08.xls"

(2009)
Deadpitch Master 2009.xls
Age_Size_Distribution (2009).xls
From: Margot's files
(I added the 2009in parentheses)
-compare to some of the other files?

(2010)
!Deadpitch Master 2010.xls
From: Margot's files
-thermal marks may be in a different file?

(2011)
Pent Channel Deadpitch 2011.Dec.EJJ.RB.xls
From: Margot's files
-the ages look wrong, all .0 -- maybe KO?
-need check against PADS; note from PT: "there is something going on with the aging data in 2011 (!Deadpitch Data LW 5_Mar_2012.xls). In Deadpitch_Original (2) sheet there are also PBS ages and the notes show that the PBS and european (ONA I assume) are missmatched in parts of the sheet. But it isn't clear which one is missmatched. Based on a brief scan, the european ages correspond better with the lengths. I am going with the Deadpitch_Original sheet for now, which doesn't have the pbs ages. "

!Copy of Deadpitch_11.xls
From: Margot's files
-needs cross-checking of files
-check these input files against the one that BJ used

!Ages Adult Sockeye 2011.xls
From: Margot's files
-check these input files against the one that BJ used

-PT noted that in 2011, the lengths don't specify POH or FL; BJ assumed FL; maybe PT used distributions to show that they were actually FLs
