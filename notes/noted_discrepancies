#List of discrepancies found in data that need to be checked

- "./data/deadpitch/SK Adult.BioData Collection Sheet 2015.xlsx" - has two copies of RawData - using the first one for now.
- tag number in "./data/deadpitch/SK Adult.BioData Collection Sheet 2015.xlsx" does not match format of tag number in other sheets, but it looks like Tag Number(s) does - using Tag Numbers(s) for now
- what does the table of data at the bottom of  "./data/deadpitch/Penticton Channel deadpitch 2019-2021.xlsx" sheet 2021 correspond to? It looks like it is some sort of summary - exlcuding for now. 
- ONA number 20350036 occurs twice in the dataset, once on 2020-11-03, and once on 2020-10-22. Both have the same otolith vial number. Are these the same fish or is there an error? They are in consecutive rows (37, 37) in the datasheet - "./data/deadpitch/Shingle deadpitch 2019-2021 (002).xlsx" and these are in the october dates. Is the November date an error? 
- "./data/deadpitch/SK Adult.BioData Collection Sheet 2014.xlsx" has okr_section and location flipped
- "../../SIRE_data/deadpitch/!SK Adult BioData Collection Sheet 2013 2Jun14.xlsx" has NS and NR. I think these are not sampled and not recorded. - switching to NA
- in 2011 there is a Deadpitch_Original (2) sheet that also has PBS ages, but these seem to be out of order in some cases - going with the ages in Deadpitch_Original
- in 2007, all of the fish id'd as kokanee based on otoliths were too large to be kokanee, and this was the case regardless of whether they were labelled as mixed up or not in the spreadsheet. I am opting to remove the age data from this year since this makes it suspect.
- in 2013 pen channel, ona_fish # 104326 is marked hatchery, but is marked unmarked for origin and is aged as a kokanee. Assuming this is an error and relabelling it a natural fish
- ages in 2007 pen channel look to be too high. Most fish are labelled as 55s which corresponds to age 4.0s, but in other years most kokanee are age 3s. The distribution of lengths for these fish also suggests that they are age 3s. For now, I am subtracting a year from these fish.
