Margot noted in the age composition summary (incorporated into the SIS workbook) that deadpitch data were preferred to broodstock samples due to a size bias (high-grading) in fish selection in the latter (for example, jacks would never be selected for hatchery purposes), but noted that in some (early) years (2003? 2004?), broodstock was all that was available. There might be some age/size differences between sample sources where we have both.  (HS pers. comm. Oct 8, 2024)
