(PT to review these suggestions and determine which might best be checked using R code as applied to the inputted files)

Things to check in the input files. Once checked, a note could be added to  "DeadpitchRawFileSourcesNotes.txt" under the file name

-figure out which years were exclusively DFO PADS ageing, and which years had both ONA and DFO ageing
-cross-compare to the PADS files? (discussed this with PT around October 7ish and he had not decided whether we should)--although now that's probably obvious from the dataset
-compare the ages in the "RawData" data file to "Aging Worksheet" and make sure they are the same (AO has done some already--I have to make a note of which ones)
-if there are other worksheets/tabs that derive some of the values shown in the "RawData", are they consistent across the different tabs?
-is it the same input file that BJ originally used? (assuming he usually used the most appropriate) If not, compare to that file 
-is there Pen Chan data in the file if it's an appropriate year? 
-ONA fish numbers? PT can check for redundancy using code
-gaps in the ONA numbers may be a flag that we missed something. I can use this to check
-Do we have the Broodstock data in all years? Should we?
-Cross compare some of the files in Margot's folders to what we used for input

"kok PADS fr RyanB - wkg.xlsx" - Seems that I incorp'd this in the "ONA & PADS 2009 Skaha kok sprs.xlsx", BUT there are "Gaff (deadpitch)" data that did not correspond to the data entry/raw data sheet that Ryan gave me. Seems the be gaff data in other years, too... but can we assume that we have the most relevant raw data file samples?
