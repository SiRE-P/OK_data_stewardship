Things to check in the input files. Once checked, a note could be added to  "DeadpitchRawFileSourcesNotes.txt" under the file name

-compare the ages in the "RawData" data file to "Aging Worksheet" and make sure they are the same (AO has done some already--I have to make a note of which ones)
-if there are other worksheets/tabs that derive some of the values shown in the "RawData", are they consistent across the different tabs?
-is it the same input file that BJ originally used? (assuming he usually used the most appropriate) If not, compare to that file 
-gaps in the ONA numbers may be a flag that we missed something. I can use this to check
-Do we have the Broodstock data in all years? No, but we don't need it at this time.
-Cross compare some of the files in Margot's folders to what we used for input
