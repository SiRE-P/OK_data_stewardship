(PT to review these suggestions and determine which might best be checked using R code as applied to the inputted files)

Things to check in the input files. Once checked, a note could be added to  "DeadpitchRawFileSourcesNotes.txt" under the file name

-compare the ages in the "RawData" data file to "Aging Worksheet" and make sure they are the same (AO has done some already--I have to make a note of which ones)
-if there are other worksheets/tabs that derive some of the values shown in the "RawData", are they consistent across the different tabs?
-is it the same file that BJ originally used? If not, compare to BJ's version and see if they have the same ONA numbers
-is there Pen Chan data in the file if it's an appropriate year; it looks like the first year with Pen Chan deadpitch was 2005 (accd files from Ryan... should I check Margot's files, too; also BJ's) *** ?? 
-ONA fish numbers? PT can check for redundancy using code
-Do we have the Broodstock data?
-Do we have the Pen Chan / Skaha deadpitch? It goes back to **before there were Sox there, i.e., biosampling goes back to 2005 (and KO enumeration goes back to 2008 I think)


-Margot's deadpitch files are available in this directory:
Margot\!MARGOT\!OKANAGAN\1 SOCKEYE\!ADULT SOCKEYE\ADULT BIOLOGICAL TRAITS
(HS has a copy of Margot's hard drive--it might be in a "laptops" superfolder, and so does PT)
